## About Me

## Intro to myself

Hello, World! My name is Christian Robles and I've been programming since 2013.

In 8th grade, I was in an engineering class where we all had to build one continuous assembly line for transporting a wooden block. The class got split into groups for a part of the assembly line and in my group I was responsible for the programming. I used a language similar to Robot-C and I liked how the code just worked. It does exactly what you ask it to. Plus doing an entire semester worth of work in 4 lines of code was pretty cool too...

After middle school, I went to a magnet high school with a Computer Science program. I graduated in 2017 and a couple days after the ceremony I started working as full-stack web developer where I have been for the past 6 years. Also after high school, I earned a Bachelors in Computer Science from UNLV.

Now that I have graduated, naturally I have begun the adventure of LeetCode grinding.

Although I took a course on Data Structures and Algorithms, I feel like I did not get a good sense on how to apply them. So, I'm going over each concept slowly to fully understand their use cases and weaknesses.

I'm also learning Python 3 to practice them in.

## My GitHub

I plan on uploading my **cheatsheets** there.

I'm aspiring to be a better programmer by learning more about programming languages and concepts. While I learn, I like creating cheatsheets to help me fully understand something and to reference in the future. I grab information that I find useful from multiple sources including official documentation. I don't plan on making them perfect or to teach someone not familiar with the language/concept everything they need to know, but more of a quick refence and some notes on trickier subjects.

I hope uploading them will help somebody! Please feel free to submit pull requests to fix them up / add to them!
